# First_homework---questions-word
1.	Share an example of a collaboration problem in your team and how it was solved.

For example, when there is a new project in our company – the project manager should make the analysis and prepare all
documents/stories which the DEVs & QA-s use after that. We, the QA-s, also analyze the tasks but at the stage when the
developers have already done their work. This can lead to neglected logics (= more bugs) when the Project Manager 
doesn’t have enough experience. And the tasks from the project are often returned to DEVs/Project Manager - which leads 
to project delays.
We (the QA-s) are trying to fight against this practice and starting asking questions regarding the project at an 
earlier stage of analysis & development.

2.	Share an example of a good collaboration between you and your colleague.

In our company the QA-s are separated into multiple small teams according the project. 
We have “WEB team”, “API team” and other. I’m part of the web testing team and I always communicate with the API people 
about the new functionalities and I give them directions so they can better understand the idea of the new functionality
on the website and to properly set their test cases in API. 

3.  What kind of automated tests your team creates and maintains?

I don’t have a lot of information – I know that they are written in Java and we use Serenity reports to follow the 
process.
